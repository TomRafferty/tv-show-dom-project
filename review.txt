Code Review:
Total Score: 83%
Summary:
Good code demonstrating solid grasp of accessing and manipulating API data. 
Well commented and satisfies all objectives up to level 500.
Try expanding on this project with the level 500 and experimenting with some level 999 challenges. 
Try replacing functions with arrow functions and for loops with foreach array methods.
Try improving aesthetic with CSS grids, fonts, and colours. 
More ideas listed on level 999 such as error handling, infinite scrolling, local storage would be great additions to this project too.
